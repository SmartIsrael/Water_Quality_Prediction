# GROUP STRUCTURE AND TASK ALLOCATION

1. Data Handler- Smart Israel
   
   **Role:** Responsible for loading the dataset and data preprocessing(cleaning, splitting the data, and scaling) it for training.

3. Vanilla Model Implementor - Teniola Ajani
   
   **Role:** Implement a baseline Neural network model with a simple architecture(no regularization or optimization techniques).

5. L1 Regularization Implementor - Emmanuel Begati
   
   **Role:** Focuses on applying L1 Regularization to the model and testing it's effect on the performance.

7. L2 Regularization Implementor - Kathrine Ganda
   
   **Role:** Responsible for applying L2 Regularization to the model and testing it's effect on the performance. Comparing its results to the vanilla model and L1 regularization.

9. Error Analysis - Anissa
    
   **Role:** Performs analysis on errors made by the models.
